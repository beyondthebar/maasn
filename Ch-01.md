# Chapter 1 The Social Network

What is a social network. Don't just say Facebook or MySpace. Break it down more. What's the "social" part? 

The social encapsulates some form of communication. Talking, chatting, messaging: those are all social. 

Is listening social? It depends on the setting, but of course it is. If I'm solitary, no one in the room, physical or virtual, that's not social.

If I'm listening to a friend at the dining table, that seems social even if I'm not saying anything. What if my friend is singing to me?

What if my friend is playing music?

Is playing music, not just your own, but any recordings, The Beatles for example, with the knowledge that someone else is listening social?
